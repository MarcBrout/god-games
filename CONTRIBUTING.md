# How to contribute

First of all, thank you for your help,
The workflow is straightforward :

## Basics

First, checkout on dev and get the latest updates :
```
$ git checkout dev && git pull origin dev
```

Now you're all set up and you can create your very own branch ! üöÄ
```
$ git checkout -b "awesome-feature"
```

Yay, you've updated and added many files, you should commit those changes !
```
$ git add $(UNTRACKED_FILES) # You can see your untracked files with `git status`
$ git commit $(FILES_TO_COMMIT) -m "relevant commit message"
```

You can now, if you want, push those on your branch
```
$ git push -u origin awesome-feature
```

After many commits, and possibly some pushes, you want to merge this awesome feature !
First of all, get the latest `dev` version ! ‚ö†Ô∏è
```
$ git fetch origin dev
```

Now you're ready for rebasing ! üôå

## Rebasing

You should always rebase before submitting a PR, if you don't, git will warn you that your local `dev` branch is late (compared to the remote)

To do so :
```
$ git rebase dev
```
You could also provide the `-i` flag (shorthand for `--interactive`) to adapt the rebase and have a clean history (this isn't necessary if your commits makes sense)
Interactive mode allows you to create a clean branch, and possibly merge / delete commits. (google is your friend)

If, during your rebase, you have some conflicts (That's normal, don't worry), you should fix those merge conflicts. Once you're done, you can do :

```
$ git add $(FILES_WITH_RESOLVED_CONFLICTS)
```

Once you resolved all your conflicts, you can :
```
$ git rebase --continue
```

Do those two steps as many times as needed, you can have multiple conflicts per rebase (If you're unlucky)

When git told you your rebase is complete, you can finnaly push (houra !)
```
$ git push -f
```

The `-f` flag forces the remote (github) to rewrite your history, this is necessary after a rebase.

Now, you can submit your PR ! üéâ
